    TO DO:
    1. Add a footnote about Darwin
-->
<p>After I have upgraded my operating system to the Big Sur, when I ran
<code class="text-box command-line-code">cmake .</code> in my project's build tree, I
got a piece of warning message from cmake and I couldn't build my target
successfully. Since cmake worked just fine before I upgraded my system,
something must have gone wrong. This post describes how I solved the problem
and serves as a memo of new stuff about CMake I have learned during the
process.</p>

<h3>How the warning appeared</h3>
<p>The terminal output from cmake is shown in Figure 1.</p>

    <figcaption>Figure 1: Terminal output from cmake containing warning message</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In Figure 1, I have divided the output into two parts and marked
them as Part 1 and Part 2 respectively. Part 1 is the warning itself,
Part 2 is additional information provided by cmake which helps you trace
back what cmake has done. Let's first take a look at Part 2.</p>

<p>The Call Stack in Part 2 gives you an idea about how cmake works. When
cmake begins to process the source tree of my project, it uses the
<span class="filename">CMakeLists.txt</span> file in the top-level source tree as an entrance point.
According to the Call Stack, I guess that(I have to guess cause I don't know yet how cmake
works internally)when cmake sees a
<span class="cmake-command">project()</span> command at line 8 of my
<span class="filename">CMakeLists.txt</span> file, it calls another cmake file which is
<span class="filename">{{ page.file1 }}</span>. So let's check that file then.</p>

<p>At line 21 in <span class="filename">{{ page.file1 }}</span>, there is an
<span class="cmake-command">include()</span> command:</p>
{% highlight cmake %}
include(Platform/${CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME}-Initialize OPTIONAL).
{% endhighlight %}
<p>What <span class="cmake-command">include()</span> does is basically running
CMake code from another file. In this case, you can figure out that the value of
<span class="cmake-var">CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME</span> is Darwin based on the filename
shown in the first line of Part 1.</p>

<p>Therefore, I have to trace back to that included file. At line 286 in
<span class="filename">{{ page.file2 }}</span>, there is a
<span class="cmake-command">message()</span> command:</p>
{% highlight cmake %}
message(WARNING "Ignoring CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT value:\n ${CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT}\n"
    "because the directory does not exsit.")
{% endhighlight %}
<p>So, combining this with the warning message shown in the terminal output,
apprently the value of <span class="cmake-var">CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT</span>
somehow is computed as <span class="text-box">{{ page.value }}</span>. And this is the origin of the problem.</p>

<h3>Why the warning appeared</h3>
<p>When cmake is first run in an empty build tree, it creates a
<span class="filename">CMakeCache.txt</span> file
and populates it with customizable settings for the project. The value of
<span class="cmake-var">CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT</span> is computed during this first
run. Because the first time I ran cmake for my project, my system is still at
version 10.15, cmake used this version number and gave it to
<span class="cmake-var">CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT</span>. In subsequent invokation of
cmake, it will use this cached variable instead of computing it again.
This is why cmake gave me a warning when I ran it after I had upgraded my
operating system to macOS 11.0.1 Big Sur.</p>

<h3>How to solve the problem</h3>
<p>In order to fix the problem, all I need to do is to change the value of
<span class="cmake-var">CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT</span> to the right version number,
which is 11.0 now on my operating system. And cmake will run without warning again!</p>
